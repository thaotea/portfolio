          Our team’s mission is to help end food insecurity. Food insecurity is
          defined as “a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active,
          healthy life.” In the San Diego region, food insecurity is a pressing
          social challenge. Research from the San Diego Hunger Coalition shows
          that in 2016 around 486,000 people in the San Diego County experienced
          food insecurity. In addition, more than 160,000 of those classified as
          food insecure in the San Diego region are children.<br><br>
          In order to address our mission, over the course of 3 months, we
          partnered with Feeding San Diego, a leading nonprofit organization in
          the San Diego region that is committed to creating a healthy and hunger-
          free San Diego. Feeding San Diego is a member of the Feeding America
          network and operates by connecting with food donors such as grocery
          stores, restaurants, and retailers to collect food that normally would
          be considered food waste. Once food is collected, Feeding San Diego
          distributes food to thousands of people across San Diego through food
          distribution sites and partnerships with nonprofits that distribute the
          food for them.

          We have decided to focus on volunteers at Feeding San Diego as our
          primary stakeholders because they are the backbone of the organization.
          We have also decided to consider the full-time Feeding San Diego staff
          as secondary stakeholders as they manage volunteer logistics and the overall
          volunteer experience.

          During the initial stages of our project, we conducted several
          contextual observations and interviewed volunteers at the Feeding San
          Diego food distribution warehouse. We interviewed these volunteers in
          the context of food sorting shifts. <br><br>
          In our field research we noticed a lot of challenges. However, the main challenge we noticed was that newer volunteers did not feel confident sorting acceptable fruit from bad fruit. At the beginning of the volunteer shift, there is minimal instruction from staff on what constitutes an acceptable versus a bad fruit. We observed newer volunteers having to consistently consult more experienced volunteers and team leads to verify if a particular fruit was bad. There is a wide variety of characteristics such as squishiness, mold, and depth of cuts that can indicate a fruit is bad. This lack of confidence and knowledge from these newer volunteers slows down the overall sorting process. And despite frequent questioning at the beginning of the volunteer shift, we noticed volunteers later in the shift still hesitated and second-guessed themselves when sorting the fruit. This led to large amounts of acceptable, edible fruit being sorted into the bad fruit pile, wasting food that could have otherwise gone on to feed hungry children and families.

          New volunteers with Feeding San Diego need a way to learn how to distinguish acceptable from unacceptable produce in order to decrease unnecessary food waste and maintain optimal efficiency in the sorting process.

          During our ideation process we came up with a variety of different solutions but ultimately decided on creating a visual poster infographic that
          would show pictures of a good apple versus a bad apple. We created one realistic infographic through pictures and hand-sketched another
          fictional infographic that showed mold, cuts, and mushiness. We tried to observe the amount of times we saw the volunteers
          look up at our infographic when they were confused. At the end of our observations, we also asked the volunteers their opinions about our prototype.
          In the end, volunteers and team leads overall liked the idea of having visuals of some kind however it was clear that infographics being placed
          alongside the wall wouldn’t be the best idea because it wasn't utilized much since volunteers turn away from the sorting area to see the posters.

          <div class="r">
            <p>
 For our second prototype we worked on iterating on our infographic onto an apron, we used realistic
 pictures to display mold and cuts because that was the preferred choice from our first prototype.
 The infographic also displayed a short description and bar where everything on
 the green side meant good and everything on the red side meant bad.
 In terms of testing our apron prototype, the volunteer leads liked how the apron was clearly visible during the entire shift.
 However, we noticed that our infographic wasn’t as intuitive when it came to differentiating bad from good and volunteers
 would take extra time comparing actual tomatoes to the ones on the infographic.

            <p>
              On our third prototype, we used the feedback we got from the initial
              prototype of the apron to improve our design and template.
              We recreated the template of the infographic to include more abstract produce pictures and better verbiage.
              Our catchphrase was “if _______ then it’s bad.”
              Below the catchphrase, we displayed different word characteristics
              that helped describe a so-called bad tomato.
               Overall, our design was validated as we got positive feedback from volunteers
               throughout the shift noting that it was straightforward and several team leads
               enjoyed wearing the apron to help explain when volunteers were confused.

                      Overall, this project helped my team and I better understand the human centered design process.
                      From immersing in the lives of the Feeding San Diego volunteers to better understanding
                      them as an organization who envisions a hunger-free and healthy San Diego.
                      This has allowed us to identify opportunities for design and prototype solutions
                      that my team hope will one day fully implement at Feeding San Diego.
                      Furthermore, working with this organization involved a lot of communication with our community partner -
                      Feeding San Diego which highly encouraged us to step outside our comfort zone and design for people outside of our populations.
                      <br><br>
  Another major takeaway from this project was that we learned to embrace criticism and ask for feedback whenever possible.
   We learned early on that Feeding San Diego has a number of different volunteers and team leads and it was nice to see their
   perspectives from all sides.
<br><br>


  Asking “WHY” was also one of the most important lessons we learned throughout this project. In learning to empathize with our stakeholders,  it helped us to better understand why we chose to work with the organization we did and why we wanted to somehow solve food insecurity  in San Diego. It often left us wondering a lot about the reasons we chose to do things the way we did and whether or not we were making the right design choices for our prototypes. It kept us on our toes and allowed us to make decisions that mattered. Ultimately, it gave us the opportunity to design with purpose and for an organization that cared about the San Diegan community.
